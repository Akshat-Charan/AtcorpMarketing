							<b>Powerful</b><br>
                            Capable of providing the maximum pressure of 1.4 MPa and dealing with medium-pressure applications as well. Work at high places and remote places is easy.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Innovative idea and light, compact size</b><br>
                            Large wheels allow the compressor to move easily even on uneven surfaces at the site (portable type).<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Easy maintenance</b><br>
                            Inlets of two cylinders are combined into one, and the large inlet filter is even easier to clean (for 2.2-kW and higher models). <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Safety design</b><br>
                            The dangerous rotating sections are guarded by the plastic belt guard and main unit cover to ensure a higher level of safety. <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Highly efficient cooling system</b><br>
                            The two-way cooling system, combining a large-capacity cooling fan and the pulley of the main unit, provides much improved cooling performance. This protects the compressor from high temperatures (for 2.2-kW and higher models).
